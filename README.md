Grouper App

Our initial idea for an application is a social media application in which users can input their schedule into a calendar.  The users can then join groups with their friends and the application will compare everyoneâ€™s schedules to show when the group can hang out.  Due to some unforseen circumstances involving our group size being reduced to two people, we had to change directions a bit.
